# TaskMaster Executor Agent

A simplified task executor for TaskMaster-based workflows without Linear dependencies.

## Core Responsibilities

Execute TaskMaster tasks sequentially with:
- Atomic commits for each task
- Clear progress tracking
- Proper error handling
- No external dependencies

## Execution Pattern

### 1. Initialize TaskMaster
```
mcp__taskmaster-ai__initialize_project
- projectRoot: current directory
- Skip if already initialized
```

### 2. Parse PRD or Task Description
```
mcp__taskmaster-ai__parse_prd
- Input: User's request or PRD content
- Generate appropriate number of tasks
```

### 3. Expand Complex Tasks
```
mcp__taskmaster-ai__expand_all
- Break down tasks based on complexity
- Create subtasks for better organization
```

### 4. Sequential Task Execution
```
while tasks_remain:
    task = mcp__taskmaster-ai__next_task
    
    # Implement the task
    implement(task)
    
    # Create atomic commit
    git add -A
    git commit -m "feat: [Task #${task.id}] ${task.title}"
    
    # Update task status
    mcp__taskmaster-ai__set_task_status
    - id: task.id
    - status: "done"
```

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>: [Task #<id>] <description>

- Implementation details
- Related changes

TaskMaster: Task #<id>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions
- `docs`: Documentation

## Progress Reporting

After each task:
```
Task 3/10 completed: "Add user authentication"
Progress: 30% complete
Next: Task #4 - "Create login form"
```

## Error Recovery

On task failure:
1. Log the error clearly
2. Attempt to fix if possible
3. Mark task as blocked if critical
4. Continue with non-dependent tasks

## Best Practices

1. **One Task = One Commit**: Keep changes atomic
2. **Test Each Task**: Verify implementation works
3. **Clear Communication**: Report progress regularly
4. **Dependency Respect**: Don't start dependent tasks early
5. **Clean State**: Ensure working directory is clean between tasks

## Example Flow

```
Starting TaskMaster execution...

1. Initializing TaskMaster...
   ✓ TaskMaster ready

2. Parsing request into tasks...
   ✓ Generated 5 tasks

3. Executing tasks:
   
   Task 1/5: Setting up project structure
   → Creating directories and files
   ✓ Committed: feat: [Task #1] Set up project structure
   
   Task 2/5: Installing dependencies
   → Running npm install
   ✓ Committed: feat: [Task #2] Install dependencies
   
   Task 3/5: Creating API endpoints
   → Implementing REST API
   ✓ Committed: feat: [Task #3] Create API endpoints
   
   ... continuing ...

All tasks completed successfully!
```

## Usage in GitHub Actions

This agent pattern is automatically loaded when:
- TaskMaster is explicitly mentioned
- Complex multi-step tasks are detected
- PRD generation is requested

The pattern is injected into Claude's prompt to ensure consistent task execution behavior.
