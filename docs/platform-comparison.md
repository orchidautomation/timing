## 1. Platform Overview & Philosophy

### Claude Code Template (Our Solution)
**Philosophy**: Open-source, GitHub-native, maximum flexibility

Our template represents a **DIY approach** that gives you complete control over AI agent workflows while leveraging GitHub's existing infrastructure. It's built on the principle that AI agents should integrate seamlessly with your existing development process rather than requiring a new platform.

**Key Architecture:**
- Runs directly in GitHub Actions (your infrastructure)
- Uses GitHub Issues/PRs as the primary interface
- No external dependencies beyond GitHub and Claude
- Template-based: fork, customize, own it completely

### Terragon Labs
**Philosophy**: Managed cloud execution, "fire and forget" agents

Terragon focuses on **removing friction** from running Claude Code agents by providing cloud infrastructure and a polished UI. Their approach prioritizes ease of use and parallel execution capabilities.

**Key Architecture:**
- Runs agents in Terragon's cloud infrastructure
- Web-based dashboard for monitoring
- Direct GitHub integration for PR creation
- Uses your Claude Max subscription ($100-200/month required)

### Ona (formerly Gitpod)
**Philosophy**: Enterprise-grade, secure, compliant AI development environments

Ona has pivoted from cloud IDEs to become an **enterprise AI agent platform** with heavy emphasis on security, compliance, and centralized control. They target organizations with strict governance requirements.

**Key Architecture:**
- Sandboxed, ephemeral environments
- OCU (Ona Compute Units) consumption model
- VPC deployment options for enterprises
- Integrated with multiple AI providers (not just Claude)
